  ## Description
  On this task i had to create a note taker app using express.js. All the front-end coding was pre-written, so my task was to create routes for the application and connect it to localhost server. The app takes in notes with title and description and saves it in its storage using the save button and you can also delete the notes if you don't find it useful anymore. For this to work first i had to create routes for GET request to pull all the HTML files and db.jason file, then i had to create route for POST request to save and add data to db.json file and lastly i had to create route for DELETE request to delete previously stored data.

  ## Acceptance criteria 
  GIVEN a note-taking application
  WHEN I open the Note Taker
  THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
  WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
  THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
  WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
  THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
  WHEN I click on the Save icon
  THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
  WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
  THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
  WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
  THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
